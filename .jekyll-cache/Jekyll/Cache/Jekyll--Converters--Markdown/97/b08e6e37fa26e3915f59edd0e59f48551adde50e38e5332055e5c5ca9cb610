<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>The future connected world in 2030 and beyond will look very different to the world we know today. 4G mobile wireless technology, that we use every day, is already giving way to the new 5G technology. A new connected, smart and intelligent society is already starting to emerge, powered by multiple access technologies including Wi-Fi, small cells, and satellite alongside terrestrial mobile cellular networks. From autonomous vehicles that are able to connect and communicate with their surroundings, to fully immersive augmented reality and virtual reality-based media and entertainment systems. From hugely efficient smart factories and end-to-end connected supply chains to the delivery of broadband connectivity to more homes than ever before, the benefits of 5G are set to reach across all areas of society.</p>

<p>But what will happen afterwards? With the speed in which technology moves, it is likely that the limits of 5G as we know and understand today may well be reached much before 2030 , the limits of 5G as we know and understand it today may well have been reached.</p>

<p>5G India Forum (5GIF), jointly with ITU-APT Foundation of India hosted an event on the evolution towards 6G and a future wireless connected society and how India can play a significant role in that evolution.</p>

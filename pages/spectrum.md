## Scope

```
<Draft>
## 
Harmonizing the use of spectrum bands across geographies is essential to achieving mass-market conditions which in turn enables cost-efficient and competitive industrial devices. Many countries have already begun to assign spectrum for 5G wide-area cellular networks, and quick regulatory actions and decisions have proven to be highly positive for all ecosystem parties, benefiting service providers and device makers with the ability to make technology investments as well as consumers with the possibility for earlier enjoyment of new generations of technology. 

Working Group - Spectrum focuses on deliberations on the technical aspects to spectrum studies, identification and allocation in India. One of the objectives of this group is in addressing concerns regarding spectrum access for 3GPP cellular technologies.
